# Semi-supervised Image Classification
![model](./projectPlan/model.png)

## To do list
[x] Create an autoencoder to reduce the images -> CNN based
[x] Add metrics to analyse the latent space -> pair plot added
[] Improve latent space with earth movers distance
[] Create a classifier based on 4 variable in latent sapce. Atleast 2 groups expected; clear from the 2 modes that are visible in pair plot.
[] Create jupyter notebook to check the outcome and add labels (semi-supervision)
